Fish Species Prediction Project

This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts fish weight (regression) and species (classification) using machine learning models. The models are trained on the Fish dataset, and predictions are made based on user input.

Features

Regression model to predict fish weight.

Classification model to identify fish species.

Flask web interface for user input and predictions.

Model training and preprocessing using scikit-learn.
